iAutomata is a finite state machine simulator for iOS based on the Cocos2D graphics animation platform.

It was originally developed as a computer science third-year project and remained on the app store for a year. I hope to renew my iOS developer subscription and continue development of the app so I can return the app to the app store.

Collaborators and contributors would be greatly appreciated!
